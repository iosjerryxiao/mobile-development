# Gitbook Collaboration Best Practices


## Why Gitbook

We want to find something different from the traditional team blogging systems.
It should allow the co-authors to easily collaborate. 
It should allow checking history versions of each article.
It should allow an article to be reviewed by the co-authors before published.
Most importantly, it should be fun.
Then we found Gitbook.
Look at the equations below to have a general idea about Gitbook:
* Github = git + code + pull request
* Gitbook = git + article

Since Gitbook integrates seamlessly with Github, so:
* Gitbook (advanced) = git + article + pull request
