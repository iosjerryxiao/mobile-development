# Gitbook Collaboration Best Practices


## Why Gitbook

We want to find something different from the traditional team blogging systems.
It should allow the co-authors to easily collaborate. 
It should allow checking history versions of each article.
It should allow an article to be reviewed by the co-authors before published.
Most importantly, it should be fun.
Then we found Gitbook.
Look at the equations below to have a general idea about Gitbook:
* Github = git + code + pull request
* Gitbook = git + article

Since Gitbook integrates seamlessly with Github, so:
* Gitbook (advanced) = git + article + pull request

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have both Github and Gitbook accounts. Please email your accounts to Jerry who will add the accounts as:
* a member of the Gitbook team(mobiledevteam)
* a collaborator of the Gitbook book
* a collaborator of the Gitbook source repo in Github

Make sure you connet your Gitbook with your Github account:
* Tap the SETTINGS tab.

##Start creating your first article for the team!

5. Make sure to save your changes when complete. Each save operation will fire a commit and push in git. You will find your newly-created branch in the [Github repo](https://github.com/iosjerryxiao/mobile-development).
6. Finally, make pull request for your branch in Github and wait for collaborators' response.
7. Done!
