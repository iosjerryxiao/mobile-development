# Gitbook Collaboration Best Practices


## Why Gitbook

We want to find something different from the traditional team blogging systems.
It should allow the co-authors to easily collaborate. 
It should allow checking history versions of each article.
It should allow an article to be reviewed by the co-authors before published.

Gitbook integrates seamlessly with Github.
Github is for coding together, while Gitbook is for writing together.
Github allows code review, while Gitbook allows article review.
