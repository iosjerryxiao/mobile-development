#Mobile Development


## About our team

We're a growing team dedicated to the development of mobile apps with members from LA and Shanghai working closely together despite remotely. 
We believe each development team should have their own blog, thus we're here.


## About our blog

This blog servers as the knowledge base for the team.

It leverages both the power of Gitbook and Github, easy to read like a book and easy to collaborate in the manner of pull requests.



Let's create a great book together!
